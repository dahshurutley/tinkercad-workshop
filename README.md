# Tinkercad Workshop 

## Intro to Tinkercad! 

Tinkercad is a web-based application designed for free and accessible 3D Modeling, Programming and Electronics. In this workshop, we will be focusing on the 3D Modeling feature of Tinkercad, in which we can do a multitude of fun things! 

## What is the process of the workshop?

In order for our novice hackers to get a better understanding of a 3D workspace and what you can do with it, we want them to experiment with Tinkercad. This web application will allow them to not only tap into their creativity, but explore and create practical uses of 3D Modeling. 

### 1. Accessing Tinkercad

Learning a new software will be difficult, so we want to walk them through  the sign-up process with our learners and help them access the 3D-Workspace. 


### 2. Tinkercad 3D Modeling Workspace

This section of the workshop is solely meant to outline all of the possible tools that can be accessed using Tinkercad. In addition, the basics of working on a 3D workspace, such as the dimensions and properties of each object and how users can scale them to how they please. 

### 3. Demo 

The demo of the workshop will be a brief demonstration of something we've created with Tinkercad. In addition, the repository for this workshop will include snippets and images of our creations for our learners to get an idea of what they could possibly create. Everything defined in the workshop will be modeled as well. 


## Accessing Tinkercad 

To access Tinkercad, we first need to create an account. By accessing this [Tinkercad Link](https://www.tinkercad.com/login), it will take you to the sign in page. Please preferably sign up with your personal email address to make things simpler. Click on the Personal Account button to sign up.

  <br> 
  Thats it! Now we can proceed to the next part of the Workshop and Create our own 3D Models! 
</p>

## Tinkercad 3D Modeling Workspace

The Tinkercad Workspace is where we will be creating our own 3D models. Each Object on this workspace has an X, Y and Z Value, defining all directions a 3D object can exist and move in. In order to move the camera, right click and move your mouse/trackpad. Using the toolbox on the right, we can access a multitude of different shapes and 3D Objects. Tinkercad has built in models that you can save and download...and even print for yourself with a 3D Printer!

You can edit the dimensions and properties of an object by placing it down on the workspace and using the pop-up menu when clicking on it.

<br> 
On the workspace, we of course can move objects wherever we please. In order to do this we can just drag, click and move the object with our mouse. In addition we can change the Length, Width, or Height of an object using one of the many squares marked on the outline of the object.

  Tinkercad even has a custom text object that you can create any message you want to within it!

## Additional Learning

The end of the workshop marks points of additional learning. In this scenario, we would like to highlight the true capabilities of 3D Modeling. The table below highlights places where you can continue 3D Modeling to a higher degree, and all of the practical uses that come with it. We hope we sparked your creativity via Tinkercad, it never hurts to create.
